MATH PROBLEM:
1.FIRST I GOT THE NUMBERS FOR WHICH NUMBER OF FACTORS FOR ITS FACTORIAL WANTS TO BE KNOWN.
2.NEXT FACCTORIALS FOR EACH IS STORED IN DIFF ARRAY.
3.ALL NATURALS NOS FOR EACH FACTORIAL TILL THE FACTORIAL NOS ARE TESTED FOR DIVISIBILITY.IF YES 1 IS ADDED TO A SEPARATE VARIABLE AND TOTAL NUMBER OF
  FACTORS IS APPENDED TO DIFF ARRAY.
4.THEN USING THE FACTORIAL ARRAY,INPUT ARRAY AND TOTAL FACTORS ARRAY OUTPUT IS DISPLAYED.  
5.END THE PROGRAM.

LOCKDOWN GAME PROBLEM:
1.ASSIGN A NUMBER TO CHOICE VARIABLE AND USE THAT CONDITION TO ENTER THE LOOP.
2.IF THE POSITION OF BOX MINUS POSITION CHANDRA MOVES IS LESS THAN 0,SURYA WINS BECAUSE CHANDRA HAS MOVED MORE THAN AVAILABLE BOXES.
3.IF CONDITION FAILS ALTERNATE PLAYER WINS.
4.IF WANTS TO STOP THE GAME VALUE OF CHOICE IS CHANGED SO THAT THE TEST CONDN OF LOOP FAILS.
5.END THE PROGRAM.

NP'S PIZZAS PROBLEM:
1.THE NUMBER OF PIZZAS FOR EACH DAY IS GOT AS INPUT.
2.THE TOTAL PIZZAS HE HAS EATEN EVERYDAY IS ADDED TO THE TOTAL NO OF PIZZAS EATEN TILL DATE AND IS APPENDED TO 
  SUMPIZZAS ARRAY.
3.THEN QUERIES IS GOT AS INPUT IN DIFF LIST.
4.THEN 1ST QUERY IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION CHECKED FOR THE CONDITION THAT IT IS LESS THAN SUMPIZZAS ARRAY.
5.WHEN THAT CONDN SATISFIES , LOOP IS BROKE AND THE INDEX OF SUMPIZZAS ARRAY IS APPENDED TO DAYS ARRAY.
6.THEN USING PRINT STATEMENT ,OUTPUT STATEMENT IS GIVEN.
7.END THE PROGRAM.

POLYNOMIAL PROBLEM:
ACTUALLY THIS PROBLEM I DONT KNOW EXACT LOGIC BUT WHILE WAS DOING COURSE ON BUISINESS ANALYTICS USING PYTHON.I CAME
ACROSS NUMPY.ROOTS()
1.FIRST THE DEGREE  OF POLYNOMIAL IS GOT.
2.COEFFICIENTS ARE GOT AS INPUT AND APPENDED TO ARRAY AND REMAINING IS PADDED AS ZEROS.
3.THEN USING NUMPY.ROOTS(),ROOTS ARE EXTRACTED.
4.END THE PROGRAM.
