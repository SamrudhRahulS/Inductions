RAM AND HIS NUMBERS PROBLEM:
1.THE NUMBER UNTIL WHICH GOOD NOS ARE TO BE FOUND OUT IS INPUTTED.
2.SECOND ALL NATURAL NOS TILL THAT NUMBERS IS APPENDED IN ARRAY.
3.EACH NUMBER IS TAKEN AND ITS HIGHEST PLACE VALUE IS FOUND.
4.THEN ALL DIGITS IS APPENDED IN ARRAY USING A FOR LOOP USING DIVISION BY 100s AND 10s AND 1s.
5.THEN REPETITIONS ARE LEFT OUT BY APPENDING UNIQUE DIGITS INTO ANOTHER ARRAY.
6.IF LENGTH OF THE FINAL ARRAY IS LESS THAN 2 IT IS STORED IN THE GOOD NUMBERS ARRAY.
7.THEN AFTER ALL NUMBERS IN INPUT ARRAY IS VERIFIED THE LENGTH OF GOOD NUMBERS ARRAY IS NO OF GOOD NUMBERS TILL THE NUMBER USER WANTS.

GURU AND ARRAY PROBLEM:
1.ALL NUMBERS ARE APPENDED AS INTEGER IN ARRAY AFTER FEW CODELINES.
2.NUMBER OF MAX OPERATIONS TO BE PERFORMED IS STORED AS INTEGER.
3.THE LOGIC HERE IS TO MOVE ALL NEGATIVE INTEGER TO EXTREME LAST AND TO COUNT ALL THE POSITIVE NUMBERS FOR THE SUM.
4.SO WHENEVER A NEGATIVE NUMBER IS ENCOUNTERED IT IS SWAPPED WITH THE LAST ELEMENT OF ARRAY AND LAST VARIABLE POINTER IS REDUCED BY 1.
5.WHEN NEXT NEGATIVE IS ENCOUNTERED WITH SECOND LAST ELEMENT IT IS SWAPPED.

MERGE MERGE PROBLEM:
1.ALL INTERVALS ARE APPENEDED AS INT IN AN ARRAY.
2.THE FIRST INTERVAL IS APPENDED IN AN ARRAY L1 AND THE HIGHER LIMIT OF FIRST INTERVAL IS TAKEN AND CHECKED AGAINST THE LOWER LIMIT OF REM INTERVAL IF IT
IS LOWER THAN THE HIGHER LIMIT OF FIRST INTERVAL.
3.IF CONDN EVALUATES TRUE, THAT INTERVAL IS ALSO APPENDED INTO L1.
4.THE MIN AND MAX VALUE OF L1 RESPECTIVELY IS APPENDED TO L2 AND L2 IS APPENDED INTO L,SO THAT LENGTH OF L IS NUMBER OF UNIQUE SETS .
